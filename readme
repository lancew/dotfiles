This is my repo for config files.

Mainly to give protection if I lose my machine (again).
Currently this is mainly my xmonad setup, and my synergy config. 

so ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs is a symlink it xmonad.hs in this repo.
and ~/.quicksynergy/synergy.conf is a symlink also.

So basically, if the box goes bang, clone this repo then create those symlinks to get the settings back. :-)
